What is "Hack the Hackpad"?
-------------------
"Hack the Hackpad" is a hack to transform hackpad to a blog CMS, and enable hackpad users to use hackpad to write and publish blog articles and provide its readers a better reading experience. 

The project is crafted by a type nerd who cares profoundly about web typography. Every design detail is brought to you with extra love and care. My goal is to make this project grow to be a competitor of blog platforms like medium. Currently it is a proof of concept hack that I put together over Christmas long holiday. More to come!

Hackpad is an awesome collaborative writing platform that has many advantages like markdown syntax support: type # and a space to make a h1 instantly, ## to h2, ### to h3; type space four times to enter code snippet; type // to enter comment.


How to use it?
-------------------
If you are a hackpad user, you now can use hackpad to publish blog articles! Go to your hackpad articles and just copy your padId which is the 11 character identifier at the end of the pad URL, and paste in the input box in the homepage. Click the gear button, then enjoy your article in much better reading experience!

> #####For example, the "how to use" article’s hackpad’s url is  `http://hackpad.com/How-to-use-HackBlog-JVgfJHOyu6O`, the padId is `JVgfJHOyu6`

You can click the **logo** to go to the **homepage**, where you can paste in padId.

You can click the **pen button** on the menu to **edit** the article on hackpad. You can edit other people’s article, with their final approval for it to go live, of course. That is the beauty of hackpad!

Tricky part: sometimes you need to hit the refresh button again if browser back button or changing the url in address bar doesn’t immediately load the correct content. Also currently it only supports the articles written in the default hackpad workspace.
